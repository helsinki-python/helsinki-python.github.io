# Code of conduct

Helsinki Python events are intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees at all Helsinki Python events.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organisers, and volunteers at any Helsinki Python event are required to conform to the
[PyCon US Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/us.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/). Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Contact information

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. They can be reached by emailing <helsinki-python@googlegroups.com> which is monitored by
Cal Paterson, Hugo van Kemenade, Jerry Pussinen and Sami Lehtinen.

In case of a conflict of interest, you can individually contact:

- Cal Paterson
  - <cal@calpaterson.com>
- TODO
  - <TODO@example.com>

Event organisers and staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist any attendee to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
