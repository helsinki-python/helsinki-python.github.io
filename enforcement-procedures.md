## Code of conduct enforcement procedures

This document summarises the procedures the Helsinki Python organisers uses to enforce the Code of Conduct.

#### Summary of processes

When the responders receive a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:

1.  Acknowledge the receipt of the report.
2.  Evaluate conflicts of interest.
3.  Call a meeting of Code of Conduct responders who do not have a conflict of interest.
4.  Evaluate the reported incident.
5.  Propose a behavioural modification plan.
6.  Propose consequences for the reported behaviour.
7.  Vote on behavioural modification plan and consequences for the reported person.
8.  Contact online community administrators/moderators to approve the behavioural modification plan and consequences.
9.  Follow up with the reported person.
10. Decide further responses.
11. Follow up with the reporter.

#### Acknowledge the report

Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgment of the receipt of their report within 24 hours.

#### Conflict of interest policy

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

-   The reporter or reported person is your manager
-   You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. It's fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.
-   The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community; the short definition is [here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour), and a longer description is [here](https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/).)
-   The reporter or reported person is your family member
-   The reporter or reported person is your direct client
-   The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.
-   The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions

Responders do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other responders should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.

Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the discussion of the incident, and recuse themselves from voting on a response to the report.

#### Evaluating a report

##### Jurisdiction

-   *Is this a Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behaviour on our list of inappropriate behaviour? Is it borderline inappropriate behaviour? Does it violate our community norms?
-   *Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's scope?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.

##### Impact

-   *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have more negative impact.
-   *Does this behaviour negatively impact a marginalised group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalised group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behaviour? Are members of the marginalised group likely to disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?
-   *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Community members often look up to community leaders to set the standard of acceptable behaviour.

##### Risk

-   *Does this incident include sexual harassment?*
-   *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behaviour put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone's mental health?
-   *Is there a risk of this behaviour being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behaviour was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behaviour from past reports?

Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more severe consequences than reports which involve lower risk or lower impact.

#### Propose a behavioural modification plan

The organisers will determine a concrete behavioural modification plan that ensures the inappropriate behaviour is not repeated. The organisers will also discuss what actions may need to be taken if the reported person does not agree to the behavioural modification plan.

What follows are examples of possible behavioural modification plans for incidents that occur in online spaces under the scope of this Code of Conduct. This behavioural modification list is not inclusive, and the organisers reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary.

-   Requiring that the reported person not use specific language
-   Requiring that the reported person not join in on specific types of discussions
-   Requiring that the reported person not send private messages to a community member
-   Requiring that the reported person not join specific communication channels
-   Removing the reported person from administrator or moderator rights to community infrastructure
-   Removing a volunteer from their duties and responsibilities
-   Removing a person from leadership of relevant organizations
-   Removing a person from membership of relevant organizations

#### Propose consequences

What follows are examples of possible consequences to an incident report. This consequences list is not inclusive, and the organisers reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary.

Possible private responses to an incident include:

-   Nothing, if the behaviour was determined to not be a Code of Conduct violation
-   A verbal or emailed warning
-   A final warning
-   Temporarily removing the reported person from the online community
-   Permanently removing the reported person from the online community
-   Publishing an account of the incident

#### Follow up with the reported person

The organisers will work with online community administrators/moderators to draft a response to the reported person. The email should contain:

-   A description of the person's behaviour in neutral language
-   The negative impact of that behaviour
-   A concrete behavioural modification plan
-   Any consequences of their behaviour

The responders should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymise any identifying information from the report. The reported person should be discouraged from contacting the reporter to discuss the report. If they wish to apologise to the reporter, the responders can accept the apology on behalf of the reporter.

#### Decide further responses

If the reported person provides additional context, the organisers may need to re-evaluate the behavioural modification plan and consequences.

#### Follow up with the reporter

A person who makes a report should receive a follow-up email stating what action was taken in response to the report. If the responders decided no response was needed, they should provide an email explaining why it was not a Code of Conduct violation. Reports that are not made in good faith (such as "reverse sexism" or "reverse racism") may receive no response.

The follow-up email should be sent no later than one week after the receipt of the report. If deliberation or follow up with the reported person takes longer than one week, the responders should send a status email to the reporter.
